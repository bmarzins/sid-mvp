# Storage Instantiation Daemon
                            
Storage Instantiation Daemon (SID) builds on top of udev and it enhances
the way udev events are handled for storage devices. SID provides
an abstraction over udev by providing an infrastructure and an API
to create modules that handle specific device types.
